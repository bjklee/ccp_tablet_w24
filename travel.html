          Monteverde’s famed cloud forests are the byproduct of fog (a thick,

          forest canopy. Trails and hanging bridges offer a close-up view of the
          diverse variety of animals and plants living in the forest.
        </p>

          One of the main tourist locations in Monteverde is the town of Santa
          Elena, which is not only home to a variety of restaurants with

          at humble street stalls to haute cuisine at romantic rooftop
          restaurants.
