        <p>
          I learnt how to cook Coca-Cola chicken wings from my mother, and I've
          since tweaked her recipe to better suit my family's palate, making it
          less sweet. While the cooking process remains straightforward, the
          result is incredibly flavorful, and once you've tried it, you'll
          understand its delicious appeal!

        <h2>Homemade Mac & Cheese</h2>
        <h3>Northern Europe</h3>
        <h3>Delish</h3>
        <h3>Main Dish</h3>
        <img
          src="images/mac_cheese.jpg"

          Macaroni and cheese, commonly known as mac & cheese, is a comfort food
          staple that has captured the hearts of people all over the world.
          Originating from Europe and popularized in the United States, this
          dish consists of elbow macaroni pasta smothered in a creamy cheese
          sauce. The simplicity of its ingredients—pasta, cheese, and often a
          touch of butter or milk—belies a rich, complex flavor that has made it
          a favorite for both quick weeknight dinners and festive holiday
          gatherings.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Macaroni</li>
          <li>Butter and flour</li>
          <li>Milk</li>

          <li>Seasonings</li>
          <li>Bread crumbs</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a 13"x9" baking dish with butter. In a
            large pot of boiling salted water, cook macaroni, stirring
            occasionally, until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 stick butter. Sprinkle
            flour over and cook, stirring, until slightly golden, 2 to 3
            minutes. Pour in milk and whisk until combined. Add mustard powder;
            season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat
            and cook, stirring, until sauce starts to thicken, about 2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove pan from heat and whisk in cheddar, Gruyère, and 1 cup
            Parmesan until melted and smooth. Stir in macaroni and transfer to
            the prepared dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, combine panko, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan.
            Sprinkle over macaroni; season with more pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake mac and cheese until bubbly and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Let
            cool for 10 minutes.
