        <p>
          Sage is a 3 year old Golden Retriever. She is one of the laziest dogs.
          She loves sneaking into the bedroom and hopping onto the neatest bed.
          She also loves riding in a car with the windows open feeling the wind
          and air. She enjoys walking, only if you take her for a ride to a big
          arboretum or park. Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily
          her cup of tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her favorite food is corn. One day, she stole corn on the cob from the
          dining table, which was surprising because she is normally gentle and
          polite. She took the stolen corn to the patio and enjoyed her meal by
          herself. Unfortunately, the corn turned out to be unripe, so she ended
          up vomiting it all later.

        <p>
          Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found
          wandering alone and taken to the Valley Humane Society where he found
          his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
          personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of
          his time staring out the window to keep watch of his house. Don’t let
          the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
          mailman and squirrels every single day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun.
          Pluto’s favorite part of the day is his daily walk. Sometimes he even
          gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy
          duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and
          so he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms,
          Seattle. He prefers to spend his days lounging on the bean bag. Every
          day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes to make
          friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the
          cyclist, but he is not allowed to give chase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun
          naps. But he hates cold weather. He would like to stay at home
          lounging by the fireplace in winter.
